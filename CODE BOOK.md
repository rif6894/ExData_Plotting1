This github respository contains four R source code files
<ol>
* plot1.R
* plot2.R
* plot3.R
* plot4.R
</ol>
These files assume:
<ol>
* The source data `household_power_consumption.txt` is in the current directory
* A subdirectory `ExData_Plotting1` exists. The output PNG files are writen to this directory. 
</ol>
The source data is located in a parent directory to ensure the source data is not included in the git checkin operation to github.

### Running the code

1. Source the appropriate `.R` file. For example `source plot1.R` 
2. Execute the functon. For example `plot1()` 
3. View the file created in the `ExData_Plotting1` directory. For example view the `plot1.png` file
